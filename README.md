# Neural Style Transfer
Imagine a world where you could transform any ordinary photograph into a masterpiece by applying the artistic style of renowned painters like Van Gogh, Picasso, or Monet. This project is designed to bring that imagination to life. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we have developed a neural style transfer model that merges the content of one image with the style of another, creating stunning new visuals that seamlessly blend the two.
This project is implementation of the paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"
## Features
* Seamless Style Transfer: Apply the artistic styles of famous painters to any photograph.
* Content Preservation: Maintain the structure and details of the original image while applying a new style.
* User-Friendly interface: Created a web interface for easy upload of content and style images.
